# Ghostwriter_Templates
A WIP collection of DOCX template files that can be used with Ghostwriter by SpecterOps

Currently only one template is published, the FULL pentest report template.
I plan to add others that are smaller in scope, such as ONLY oplogs, or a different format that focuses more on an OSCP style proof.txt/flag.txt concept.

Although it is called 'FULL' the intention is for this to be a template and be customized for your organization/individual needs.
Replacing the ghostwriter logo, reorganizing the doc flow, etc. All can be done with editing the template in MS word. 
I don't recommend LibreOffice for this; I had a lot of issues with the template linter after saving files edited in it.
